# Update Order API

## Endpoint
PUT /order

## Headers
- x-user-role: (Required) 'employee' or 'customer'

## Body Example
{
  "orderId": "234567",
  "orderStatus": "Completed", // Only for 'employee'
  "orderItem1": ["Big Potato", "Butter", "Chives"],
  "specials2": "Holiday Feast Potato"
}

## How It Works
- Items in the body are **added to the order**, while any not provided are **removed**.
- Employees: Can update all fields, including `orderStatus`.
- Customers: Can only update orders with `orderStatus` = "Pending" and modify `orderItemX` or `specialsX`.

## Returns
- 200: Order updated successfully, with details of changes.
- 400: Missing `orderId` or invalid request.
- 403: Access denied (e.g., insufficient permissions).
- 404: Order not found.
- 500: Server error.

### Example Return (200)
```json
{
  "message": "Order 234567 updated successfully",
  "changes": ["Butter added to orderItem1", "Holiday Feast Potato added to specials2"],
  "statusChange": "Order status changed from 'Pending' to 'Completed'",
  "modifiedAt": "2024-12-13T12:00:00Z"
}
